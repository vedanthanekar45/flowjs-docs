# Optimizations

In the initial release version of this project, we decided to include some hardcoded optimization techniques to make the scene render smoother than ever.

The techniques in `v1.0` include:

## Level of Detail

Level of Detail (LOD) in graphics is a performance optimization technique that adjusts the complexity of an object based on its distance from the viewer or its importance in a scene. 

By using simpler models for distant or less crucial objects and more detailed models for those closer to the camera, developers can significantly improve rendering speed and efficiency without a noticeable loss in visual quality. 

This is a technique that has been greatly used in video games and AR/VR simulations.

LOD requires the creation of lower-poly clones based off your original model. That task can be pretty daunting for a user with no 3D experience at all. 

This problem can be solved with a simple command consisting of two parameters, the input, that is the path of your model, and your output, that is, the path where you want to store the clones:

``` bash
npx generate-lod-models /path/to/your/model.glb /path/to/your/output
```

This command will create 3 identical models, each with low polygon count than the other, with hardcoded properties.

To actually enable level of detail, all you have to do is enable a single parameter while loading your model:

``` javascript
const myModel = await loadGLTF('path/to/your/model_LOD0.glb', {
    lod: true
})
```
`model_LOD0.glb` is the highest poly model available.

When you set the `lod` parameter to `true`, it will look at the name of the highest poly model, and look for lower poly models, named as `model_LOD1.glb`, `model_LOD2.glb`, etc.

You don't have to do anything, the models generated by the bash script will follow the above naming convention by default.

Try it out! You can also refer to this example scene.

## Progressive Loading

Progressive loading in 3D is a technique for rendering 3D models by loading and displaying a low-resolution version first, then gradually adding more detail as the full data is received. 

This improves the user experience by allowing a scene to be viewed quickly, preventing the user from waiting for the entire model to download before anything appears. 

Instead of showing a blank screen, the user sees a rough, low-quality version that becomes clearer over time. 

This feature works automatically with Level of Detail. If you've loaded a model with `lod: true`, Flow will automatically use the lowest-poly version (`model_LOD2.glb`) for the initial display and then progressively load the more detailed models.

## Compression

This is another hardcoded feature. Compression reduces the file size of 3D data by removing redundant information, without affecting the overall visual quality of the model.

It improves transmission speed, storage efficiency, and real-time performance for graphics applications. 

Due to the large size and complex structure of 3D models and point clouds, compression is essential for use in gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and medical imaging. 

## Conclusion

Using these methods, Flow tries to optimize the rendering of 3d models on browsers and significantly reduce load time and storage efficiency.
